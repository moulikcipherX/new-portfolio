            Introduction

          <p class="lede">
            I am Moulik Aggarwal, a computer science and engineering geek from Amity University Rajasthan, Jaipur,
            India. I always want to work on Cloud and Web technologies 3. I love to contribute to Open Source as well as
            I am also an Open Source Influencer and love to work with different communities in my city e.g. Facebook
            Developer Circles Jaipur, GDG Jaipur, PyJaipur and many more.

            What was my open source experience before this project?
          </p>
          <p class="lede">
            I started contributing in October 2018 in Hacktoberfest. I started contributing in small projects so that I
            can learn the working of git and GitHub. Then I have a pause for almost a month until I started again
            contributing in good and growing projects this winter by NJACK by IIT Patna and KWoC by IIT Kharagpur. If
            you want to know more About KWoC and my contributions.

            What was the most challenging thing about my experience?
          </p>
          <p class="lede">
            The most challenging part was to create a new package from the scratch which I never did that. The next
            thing I faced is we have to change our plan of action for the package because of deprecation of TSLint and
            we have to use a new package i.e. typescript-eslint for Typescript as well as JavaScript. I have to learn
            without any reference from the developers of typescript-eslint on creating custom rules in Typescript. In
            the end, the whole GSoC part was not planned everything is random and we still have a lot of things to do.

            Advice for new contributors in Open Source

            Advantages of Open Source for my career
          </p>
          <p class="lede">
            Before I tell you about the advantages of open source in your career you must know something about the
            relationship of GSoC and open source.
            It is nothing on preparing it is not an exam that everyone has to pass. GSoC is introduced to promote open
            source and students can work on real-life projects and learn and do work in real-world with the
            professionals. So, I suggest you to start working in any organization and contribute without any
            expectations and when the day comes you will know what you have to do. Do work in Open Source when you feel
            it otherwise doesn’t do it.
            Now It is time for you to know the benefits of working in open source projects:

            <ul class="lede-list">
              <li class="lede-list__item">It will develop your Software Engineering skills like working on small modules
                for a product.

            Conclusion
          </p>
          <p class="lede">
            I loved to work with Salesforce and I will continue to maintain the project and contribute to the project.
            There are many projects on Salesforce in different fields. I prefer to see the projects on Salesforce Open
            Source.
            I am thankful for my mentors Philipe Navarro (RasPhilCo) and Travis Longoria (elbandito) of the project who
            were there to guide me.
